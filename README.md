# gRPC PHP Server and Client Library

This repository is a fork of [grpc-php](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-php).

It adds callbacks to implement custom behavior before and after processing an RPC call.
An error callback is also added, to implement application-specific error handling.

To install gRPC for PHP, and for any further instructions please see https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/php
